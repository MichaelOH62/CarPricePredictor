# CarPricePredictor
CS370 Semester Project

The goal of this project is to utilize a dataset from kaggle to train a model that can predict what the cost of a used vehicle will be.\
This code can be used with an application that takes user input for a used vehicle that is going to put on sale.\
The input will be compared against the model to create an output of what the asking price for the vehicle should be.\
Used car dealerships can make use of an application like this to easily get an idea of what to make the asking price.
